Both this urbanization, which shifted the geographical focus of blues away from its traditional Southern Roots, and the invention of the electric guitar (which had gained popularity in the Jazz Big Bands of 1930s) gave birth to the adoption of the electric guitar into Blues. Early Traditional Electric Blues traces include West Coast Blues guitarist T-Bone Walker (originally form Texas), who began experimenting with the electric guitar in the mid 1930s in Los Angeles. While in the 1940s, in Memphis, Memphis Minnie, Muddy Waters and Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup in Chicago, in Texas, Sam \"Lightnin Hopkins and in Detroit, John Lee Hooker. Through the 1950s-1970s, Traditional Electric Blues paved the way for other genres including Rock N' Roll, R&B, Soul and Classic Rock many artists of which continued to expand the aesthetic potential of the Blues by applying more contemporary instrumentation to it, all the while upholding the essential components of Blues music in their compositions.

Traditional Blues represent the structural and cultural genesis of blues, a genre that manifested an array of African-American cultural experience (i.e. spirituals to work songs to field hollers) into a three-phrase lyrical prose aligned within a 12-bar song structure. The 12-bar blues song-form is musically identified by a thematic, three-chord progression which uses the tonic, sub-dominant and dominant chords of the scale and a melodically alternating, bended 'blue note': a lowered third scale degree (or mediant), which alternates with frequent improvisation, between its natural third scale degree. Rooted in the traditions of the Deep South and also known as Country Blues, Traditional Acoustic Blues is primarily minimal in instrumentation (i.e. a vocalist accompanied by an acoustic guitar) and lyric themes tend to focus on hardship and sorrow.","taggable":true,"templateId":null,"qualifierTemplates":[],"sortIndex":2}],"sortIndex":0},{"id":"9d557d09-c923-410c-b2c9-3239d073d703","name":"Classical","description":"Traditional Western art music.

Baroque music often features elaborate musical ornamentation and looser implied rules regarding counterpoint and dissonance than Renaissance music. Western musical groups and forms expanded in size, range, complexity and variety during the Baroque era - forms such as the opera, cantata, oratorio, solo concerto, sonata, and fugue emerged during this time. In contrast to later Classical eras, Baroque performers were often skilled improvisers of melodic lines and accompaniment, and improvisation and ornamentation were fundamental elements of many Baroque performances. The Baroque era saw the increasing preeminence of instruments and instrumental forms - composers began to write for specific instruments and instrumental ensembles with texture in mind, as opposed to the earlier Renaissance focus on vocal music and the limitation of instrumental music largely to transcriptions of vocal music.","taggable":true,"templateId":null,"qualifierTemplates":[],"sortIndex":2},{"id":"6692e0f5-2105-4bf7-9176-0a3c07b41bc3","name":"Romantic","description":"Romantic music consists of Western art music written approximately from the late 18th century to the early 20th century.

A growing middle class and increased demand for public concerts led to greater independence of composers from wealthy patrons.
